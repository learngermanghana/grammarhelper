# Grammar Helper

This Streamlit app is used to review student submissions against reference answers.

## Configuration

Settings can be supplied through `streamlit` secrets or environment variables.

- `ANSWER_SOURCE`: preselects the reference answer source. Valid options are `"json"` or `"sheet"`.
  If not set, the app picks whichever source is available.

Example `secrets.toml` entry:

```toml
ANSWER_SOURCE = "json"
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export ANSWER_SOURCE=sheet
```

Run the app with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
